This study further investigates current discoveries in psycho- and computational linguistics, since:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Existing works in semantic fMRI encoding %refs or decoding schemes %refs use a generic text embedding space,
    \item Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.\\
    \end{itemize}
        
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item This work was done wholly while in candidature for \degreename.
        \item Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
        \item Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
        \item Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
