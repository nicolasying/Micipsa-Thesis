\section{Semantic Embeddings}
\subsection{Validation on English Data}
For \code{SIM} space, we used the English \code{WordNetEmbedding} trained on the first 15,000 frequent words and benchmark dataset vocabulary. We kept first 511 PCs by following the method in Section \ref{subsec:semanticsimilaritymethod}, which is comparable to the best dimensionality (850) reported by the original work \parencite{saediWordNetEmbeddings2018} for a \code{WordNetEmbedding} keeping all semantic relations.

The intersection of \code{SIM} space and the Common Crawl vocabulary used in \code{MIX} space resulted to 8157 words. 

The linear regression model mapping \code{SIM} to \code{MIX} produced a \code{r2} score of 0.1662.

Figure \ref{fig:EngDecorVarRatio} shows the PCA-factored explained variances of the 4 resulting semantic space PCs. Table \ref{tab:engdecorrelationscores} shows the semantic ranking task evaluations. Conformably to our hypotheses, the untouched \code{MIX} space is indeed a mixture of \similarity and \association information. \code{SIM}, which is constructed with specifically picked semantic relations from \code{WordNet}, is purely \similarity with statistically negligible \association scores. Though we have not completely purged \similarity information from \code{ASN} and \association from \code{SIG}, each resulting semantic space has significantly reduced the score in its irrelevant semantic axis. In addition, a clear dominance of \association semantic signal is present in \code{ASN} and \similarity in \code{SIG}.

\subsection{Application on French data}

Provided with the methodological success of English data, we applied the same algorithm against French data.

For \code{SIM} space, we used the French \code{WOLFEmbedding} with POS tag trained on all the available vocabulary. We kept first 634 PCs.

After rule-based and manual matching, the intersection of \code{SIM} space and the \code{MIX} space vocabulary resulted to 24519 distinct lemma with POS tags.

The linear regression model mapping \code{SIM} to \code{MIX} produced a \code{r2} score of 0.0776, which is lower than the English score, indicating a smaller informational overlap between the two embedding models.

Figure \ref{fig:FreDecorVarRatio} shows a similar PCA explained variance distribution. Though no sound evidence supporting the validity of the French benchmarks, we tested the resulting semantic spaces using the same tasks against our indicative gold-standard data (Section \ref{subsection:frenchbenchmarkdataconstruction}). The unmodified \code{MIX} space has a much lower score in \similarity and \association compared to the English \code{MIX}, setting a weak baseline for embedding space comparison. Again, \code{SIM} achieves high scores in \similarity, and negligible scores in \association. However, the results (Table \ref{tab:fredecorrelationscores}) puts the validity of \code{ASN} space into question: viewed by Pearson's \code{r} it seems to contain none of \similarity and \association information, judged by Spearman's \code{r}, both axes' information are present in the space. All p-values reported for \code{ASN} are close to the significance threshold. However, \association scores of \code{ASN} are nevertheless higher than \similarity scores. Despite that \code{SIG} represents only a very small portion of variances of the \code{MIX} embedding as indicated by a low \code{r2} score, \code{SIG} has comparable \similarity scores as \code{SIM}, and the purity against \association is even more remarked.

    \caption[EVR of 4 Semantic Spaces, French]{PCA of 4 semantic spaces of the French 24519 vocabulary. \textbf{Left panel}: Due to the poor linear correlation found between \code{SIM} and \code{MIX}, the variance of \code{SIG} is systematically smaller than the other three spaces, the original space \code{SIM} has larger variances. The suppression of \code{SIG} from \code{MIX} has also little impact on the model's variance. \textbf{Right panel}: \code{SIG} has a denser variance concentrated on first PCs, while the other three spaces have more homogeneous variance distributions.\label{fig:FreDecorVarRatio}} 
    
\end{figure}

\input{Tables/freSemanticRankingTask}


To further control the quality of the resulting spaces, particularly that of \code{ASN} due to debatable scores, we visualized the French semantic spaces with an embedding projector\footnote{Published as a TensorFlow component, available at \url{https://projector.tensorflow.org/}. The entries in the embedding space is presented by a sphere positioned in a 3D space, of which the coordinates are by default calculated with the first 3 PCs.} to visualize several exemplar lexicon units and its vectorial neighbors. Based on this analysis (examples in Section \ref{appsubsec:projectorvisu}), we are convinced that French \code{ASN} has a predominant \association preference.


\section{Computational Analysis of Ridge Regression}

\subsection{Regressor Generation}

\subsubsection{Vocabulary Coverage}
Each word (lemma) in the narrated story used in fMRI experience is associated with its \code{RMS} acoustic feature temporal evolution and its semantic values in different spaces. However some of the content words are not all available in our obtained spaces (Table \ref{tab:lppcoverage} and \ref{apptab:lppcoverage}). When generating regressors, the semantic vectors are set to zero for out-of-vocabulary lemmas. 

\input{Tables/lppCoverage}

\subsubsection{Corpus-Targeted Semantic Feature Selection}

The PCA dimension cutting methods presented in Section \ref{subsec:semanticsimilaritymethod} produced 634 feature dimensions for French \code{SIM}. After having generated regressors with word onset timestamps and semantic representation vectors, the average variance cross 9 groups of 103 resulting regressors are computed and visualized in Figure \ref{fig:freSIMRegVar}. We selected the threshold of \(10^{-5}\), which resulted 100 informative regressors for \code{SIM} space\footnote{The selected dimensions are 1 -- 85, 87 -- 94, 96, 97, 99, 100, 103, 117, 131.}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \makebox[\linewidth]{
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/SimDimensionSelectionRegLPP.pdf}
    }
    \caption[French \code{SIM} Regressor Variances]{The average of 9 fMRI run semantic regressor variances. There are 3 non-embedding regressors, and 634 \code{SIM}-based regressors. \code{RAW} stands for regressor values directly after hemodynamic convolution, \code{ORTHONORMAL} stands for de-linearized regressors after Gram-Schmidt process. \code{THRESHOLD} for regressor selection is fixed at \(10^{-5}\). The \code{RAW} regressors' variance declines dramatically after first few \code{SIM} regressors (dim > 3), and stays relatively stable for later dimensions. This observed trend corresponds well to the eigenvalue evolution of \code{SIM} space (Figures \ref{fig:SimDimensionSeletionVarRatio} and \ref{fig:FreDecorVarRatio}). \code{ORTHONORMAL} regressors's variance declines more slowly, and has a noised plateau around dimension 100 -- 300. Later regressors suffer more significantly in variance (smaller than \(10^{-23}\), approaching the computation precision limit of Python \code{float}s) and retained almost no information for the second half PCs. The threshold is cut around the upper bound of the \code{ORTHONORMAL} variance plateau noise, so a continuous regressor set could be included in the final design matrix without surpassing the dimensionality limit (of 200 which is the dimensionality of the used DepGlove embedding).} 
    \label{fig:freSIMRegVar}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Choice of \(\alpha\) and Effective Feature Dimensionality}

For each of four semantic models, we generated design matrices for each fMRI session with 103 or 203 features (including 3 non semantic embedding features). 

Analysis in Section \ref{appsubsec:alphadim} suggests that our research space for \(\alpha\) and feature-dimension parameters are complete: the distribution of voxel-configurations are bounded by our search space (see Figure \ref{fig:MIX_HeatmapAlphaDimS1R0} for the \code{MIX} distribution of subject 1 for an example, session-wise distribution plotting for all models are available online [TODO, add url]). 

Section \ref{appsubsec:alphadim} also illustrates the interaction between \(\alpha\) values and voxel regression performances, it confirms that a uniform \(\alpha\) setting penalizes certain cognitive models thus creating an important bias for model selection (see Section \ref{sec:ridgemethod}), supporting our choice of voxel-wise \(\alpha\) configuration.

A large proportion of voxels are best modeled with no Ridge regularization (especially for voxels using <4 features). Voxel-models requiring for higher-dimensional features are associated with larger \(\alpha\) values. A diagonal trend is found bounding  \(\alpha\). \(\alpha > 10^{4.5} (31989)\) rarely achieves best predictive performances, suggesting that the \(\alpha\) search space is complete for the subject.}

\section{Cognitive Analysis of fMRI Encoding}

For convenience, the voxel-model predictive performance is considered as voxel activations in response to different feature sets.

Figure \ref{fig:BASE_ContrastMapG} illustrates the group-wise results for non-semantic-embedding feature classes. Subject-wise results are available online\footnote{\url{http://bit.ly/micipsa_base_wholebrain}}. Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:histo_base_best_nonsub_G} shows the exact impact on addition of \code{WRATE} and \code{CWRATE} \emph{feature groups} to the design matrix, without substituting worse nesting-model results with better nested-model results. Subject-wise results are available online\footnote{\url{http://bit.ly/micipsa_regression_histogram}}, the overfitting with feature additions are more pronounced.

\code{RMS} preferentially models primary auditory cortical activities in Broadmann Area (BA) 41, together with other two clusters located in right mid cingulum and right middle frontal cortex (Table \ref{tab:rmsCluters}). The addition of \code{WRATE} does not bring any impact (Figure \ref{fig:histo_base_best_nonsub_G} left panel), possibly due to the high co-linearity with \code{RMS} by definition, thus the orthonormalized feature contains only uninformative noises despite a relatively important variance (0.96 after orthonormalization, \code{CWRATE} has only 0.10 for reference). With \code{CWRATE}, an extensive range of voxels distributed in the whole brain received better performance (Figure \ref{fig:histo_base_best_nonsub_G} middle panel). 

A left-hemisphere preference for textual listening comprehension is suggested: left primary auditory cortex (BA41) is better modeled than in right hemisphere with \code{RMS} and \code{CWRATE}. On adding \code{CWRATE}, the imbalance between left and right BA41 is enlarged. Table \ref{tab:cwrateImprovementClusters} reports 4 clusters containing more than 16 voxels that are improved (W=136, \(\Delta\)\code{r2}>0.0067, p-value<\(10^{-3.66}\) uncorrected) in left BA37 (MTP), bilateral BA37 (Fusiform Gyrus) and left Rectus. The Wald F-test on \code{CWRATE} contrast reports isolated voxels surviving voxel-wise multi-comparison significance test (Table \ref{tab:Ftest}, p-value<0.05 voxel-wise multi-comparison corrected). The voxels are mainly located in bilateral BA37, left BA18, 19.

F-test in \textbf{right lower panel} reports significant voxels in left pMTG BA21, 39, right pSTG BA22 and left Heschl BA4 (Table \ref{tab:Ftest}).

    \caption[Histogram of \code{r2} with \code{SIM/ASN} Features]{The group average of semantic embedding models make both important contributions for voxel-modeling (\textbf{left} and \textbf{mid} panels). \textbf{Right} panel shows that \code{ASN} model scores are distributed around a higher average (0.014) than \code{SIM} (0.01). Subject-wise results are available online at \url{http://bit.ly/micipsa_regression_histogram}.} 
    \label{fig:SIM_ASN_Distribution}
\end{figure}

\input{Tables/simImprovementClusters}

We added with upon non semantic-embedding models \code{SIM} freatures to construct \similarity semantic models. While the whole-brain activation pattern stays globally unchanged (Figure \ref{fig:SIM_ContrastMapG} for group-wise average), in \code{SIM} voxel-models, left primary cortex are better ranked than in \code{BASE} model, while right mid cingulum models degrade (Table \ref{tab:rmsCluters}). \code{SIM} enlarges the performance superiority of left STG over right STG, indicating a left preference for textual semantic \similarity processing. The shrinkage of Mid Cingulum's proportion in top 1\% voxel models might imply that it has a limited participating in \similarity processing. The \code{r2} distribution analysis (Figure \ref{fig:SIM_ASN_Distribution} left) shows that in group-average \code{SIM} is informative for most of the voxel-models and none of voxels is overfitted by this addition. Table \ref{tab:simImprovementClusters} reports the most improved voxel clusters by \code{SIM} to be located in bilateral MTG, left Sup Parietal and right Angular Cortex (W=210, \(\Delta\)\code{r2}>0.0079, p<\(10^{-4.35}\) uncorrected). Left MTG improvements are more extensive and more important than right MTG. F-test results shows that \code{SIM} significantly improves isolated voxels (Table \ref{tab:Ftest}, p<0.05 voxel-wise multi-comparison corrected) in left pMTG BA21, 39, right pSTG BA22.

\subsubsection{\emph{Similarity} Nested Model with \code{SIG}}

\code{SIG} contrasts with \code{CWRATE} class models gave similar contrast maps as \code{SIM}: bilateral IFGtri, MTG and ITG, SPG and AG are found. With \code{SIG} the left ITGtri and left ITG improvements are more drastic. A more detailed presentation of \code{SIG} results is available in Section \ref{subsec:sig}.

\subsection{\emph{Association} Nested Model}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \makebox[\linewidth]{
    \includegraphics[width=.8\paperwidth]{Figures/ASN_ContrastMapG.pdf}
    }
    \caption[Encoding with \code{ASN} Features, Group]{\textbf{Left panels}: Consistent with former results, the addition of \code{ASN} on \code{BASE} regressors does not change the bilateral primary auditive cortices' dominance. Improvements of voxel-models are distributed in an extensive part of all lobes (\textbf{right upper panel}). The most improved voxels are located in bilateral MTG, IFGtri, mid occipital cortex, angular gyrus, sup/mid frontal cortex, mid cingulum  (Table \ref{tab:asnImprovementClusters}). F-test in \textbf{right lower panel} reports significant voxels in right lingual BA19 and mid occipital area BA18 (Table \ref{tab:Ftest}). Subject-wise results are available online at \url{http://bit.ly/micipsa_asn_wholebrain}.} 
    \label{fig:ASN_ContrastMapG}
\end{figure}


On addding \code{ASN} features on \code{BASE} features, the bilateral auditive cortices dominance is consistently kept (Figure \ref{fig:SIM_ContrastMapG} for group-wise average). The contribution brought by \code{ASN} on top 4 voxel-clusters initially found by \code{RMS} model is similar to \code{SIM} (Table \ref{tab:rmsCluters}): improvement in bilateral Prim Auditory with a slight left preference, shrinkage of right MCingulum and slight improvement of frontopolar PFC. These clusters therefore do not show an observable preference for \code{SIM} and \code{ASN}.

\code{ASN} brings voxel-model performance boost in an extensive cortical regions. The Wilcoxon test shows near-significant performance improvements (W=190, \(\Delta\)\code{r2}>0.0065, p-value<\(10^{-4.18}\) uncorrected) in left BA39 (visual), right angular gyrus (associated with aphasia), right BA21 MTG, left BA37 fusiform gyrus (Table \ref{tab:asnImprovementClusters}). F-test results shows that \code{ASN} significantly improves isolated voxels (Table \ref{tab:Ftest}, p-value<0.05 voxel-wise multi-comparison corrected) in right lingual gyrus BA19 and BA18 (visual association).

Subject-wise results are available online at \url{http://bit.ly/micipsa_sim_asn_contrast}} 
    \label{fig:EMB_SIM_ASN_ContrastMapG}
\end{figure}

\input{Tables/sim_asnContrastCluster}

Section \ref{appsubsec:nonnestedcompres} suggests that first feature dimensions of \code{SIM} can be partially recovered by \code{ASN} model. Therefore, \code{ASN} might also be able to model voxels using less than 5 features from \code{SIM}, the result might thus lack low-level \code{SIM}/\code{ASN} contrast. As the first 4 dimensions of \code{SIM} encodes primarily POS information (Section \ref{appsubsec:projectorvisu}), we performed ad-hoc regressions on \code{SIM} space but uses only lemmas from a certain grammatical category to identify possible impacted regions (upcoming). 

The found results are consistent with the conjectures above: \code{ASN} scores are higher than \code{SIM} in average (Figure \ref{fig:SIM_ASN_Distribution} right), most of voxels respond better to \code{ASN} models (Figure \ref{fig:EMB_SIM_ASN_ContrastMapG}). As the Wilcoxon test shows (W>6945, \(\Delta\)\code{r2}>0.0068, p-value<0.05 voxel-wise multi-comparison corrected), only two significant clusters are found for \code{SIM} in left superior frontal cortex and left anterior cingulum cortex (both associated with control/decision-related cognitions) (Table \ref{tab:simasnContrastClusters_sim}) and 17 are found for \code{ASN} (Table \ref{tab:simasnContrastClusters_asn}) in bilateral visual association areas (BA18), primary visual areas (BA17), ventroposterior temporal areas (fusiform, hoppocampus and parahippocampus). 

The reported clusters for \code{SIM} are composed of 4 to 5 voxels. In our ROI analysis, ROIs larger than 26 voxels are used, thus none of the ROI revealed significance for \code{SIM}. As \code{ASN} has an overall dominance for almost all brain regions, small ROIs located in left middle/posterior STG and large anatomical structures including IPL and TL all revealed their preference for \code{ASN} model.
